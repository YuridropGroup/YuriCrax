# Welcome to YuriCrax.

## [ 0 ] What is YuriCrax?

YuriCrax is a set of tools that enable script kiddies, developers, crackers and repackers to create their own cracked versions of games using automated tools and custom-tailored DLL files and automated repacking tools and scripts to compress them as far as our ability allows. In this repository also includes the source code for our game installer.

This is based off of various currently existing tools and famous people within the scene. Notably this includes people/groups such as RUNE and Fitgirl and tools such as Precomp and Goldbergs Steam Emulator (GBE).

The source code for our launcher similar to Steam but for cracked versions of the game is currently not yet out and will be uploaded to a different repository which will also be open source. This will include an achievement system for various games mimicking that of Steams.

## [ 1 ] What is the point of YuriCrax when other tools exist?

The point of YuriCrax is to allow ease of access for everyone whether they have experience or not in the scene. The current tools used to crack and repack can be very sparse accross the internet and difficult to set up for someone with no knowledge on how any of this works. Usually being a script kiddie is bad but in the case of game cracking and repacking it is best that people are comfotable cracking and repacking their own games if they are weary of malware, which is completely understandable.
